## Additional notes

Here is a list of the multiple things I would have improved if this was a real case project, and the scope of the assignment was not only for presentation purposes:

- Refactor code:
    * Move all the database calls to separate files
    * Improve CSS by introducing more variables and more common/global selectors
    * Make separate component for the item on lists to be reused in other components (e.g. items are almost the same on food entry list and meal list)
- Performance testing 
- Unit testing
- WCAG Compliance
- Security Compliance:
    * CSP
    * Firebase Security
- Overall look & feel (with a designer or a styleguide)
